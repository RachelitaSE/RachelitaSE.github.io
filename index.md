# Rachel Steinitz Eliyahu 👋  
*Graduate Student in the [Refaely-Abramson Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/MCMS/Sivan/home)*  

## About Me  
Hello! I’m Rachel Steinitz Eliyahu, a graduate student at the Weizmann Institute of Science (Department of Materials & Interfaces). My research interests revolve around the physics of excited-state phenomena in materials — understanding how structure, composition and dynamics influence processes such as exciton formation, transport and decay.

## What I’m Doing  
- Currently working in the Refaely-Abramson Lab focusing on advanced ab initio many-body computational methods for excited states in materials.  
- Exploring topics like exciton diffusion, exciton-phonon coupling, charge transfer at interfaces and how these phenomena can be manipulated for applications in energy conversion and quantum information.  

## Projects & Skills  
- **Computational Materials Science**: Many-body perturbation theory, GW/BSE methods, density functional theory (DFT)  
- **Programming & Automation**: Python scripting, data analysis, high-performance computing workflows  
- **Future Goals**: Develop efficient workflows for predicting excited-state properties, collaborate at the intersection of materials science and machine learning
