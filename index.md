## About Me  
Hello! Iâ€™m Rachel Steinitz Eliyahu, a graduate student at the Weizmann Institute of Science (Department of Materials & Interfaces). My research interests revolve around the physics of non-adiabatic phenomena in materials â€” from the development of the theory through the code to understanding interesting phenomenas.

## What Iâ€™m Doing  
Currently working in the Refaely-Abramson Lab focusing on the code development of our latest paper on the Exact-factorization DFPT (https://journals.aps.org/prb/pdf/10.1103/dmpv-zqdh).  


## Projects & Skills  
- **Computational Materials Science**: Many-body perturbation theory, GW/BSE methods, density functional theory (DFT), density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)
- **Theory development**: Expanding the theory of Exact factorization to the solid state. 
- **Programming & Automation**: Python scripting, data analysis, high-performance computing workflows
