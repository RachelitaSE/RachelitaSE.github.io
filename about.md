# About

I’m Rachel Steinitz Eliyahu, a graduate student at the Weizmann Institute (Materials & Interfaces).  
I’m currently in the **[Refaely-Abramson Lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/MCMS/Sivan/home)**.

My goal is to develop a new methodology to caclulate non-adiabatic phenomena in solid state materials.
